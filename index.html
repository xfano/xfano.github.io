I’ve decided to take the self-study route instead of the traditional route because I’m no longer living with my parents. Although the self-study route is the most affordable option I have, I also prefer not having to study courses that are not of my interest and are not related to the Linux/GNU sysadmin career.<h3 id=why-linux-gnu-sysadmin><a aria-label="Anchor link for: why-linux-gnu-sysadmin" class=zola-anchor href=#why-linux-gnu-sysadmin> ### </a> Why Linux/GNU Sysadmin?</h3><p>What I love about Linux/GNU is that it gives me the right and freedom to customize it to however I like it. It gives me a satisfying experience in installing, fixing and modifying. I’ve longed to experience that since I was 16 years old because we didn’t have a family computer early on. But it didn’t stop me from doing some fixing and exploring on Windows. I was only able to go full-on Linux 8 years later, year 2020. I haven’t looked back since. I enjoy exploring and learning more about Linux as much as I love helping other people in installing an Operating System and fixing a problem in their machine. If I have to spend most of my lifetime to work so me and my loved ones can survive, it’s better to work on something that I’m passionate about. I believe in freedom, cooperation, and in Open Source Software, so Linux/GNU sysadmin it is for me.<h3 id=which-distro-am-i-currently-enjoying><a aria-label="Anchor link for: which-distro-am-i-currently-enjoying" class=zola-anchor href=#which-distro-am-i-currently-enjoying> ### </a> Which distro am I currently enjoying?</h3><p>Void Linux<hr></main>
